## Fortran for Scientists and Engineers 

This repository is a collection of all the programming exercises in the book *Fortran for Scientists and Engineers*. I worked through the exercises to become 
fluent in the Fortran programming language. My motivations for learning Fortran are because I am currently working as a research assistant in the physics department 
of Kalamazoo College, and I am working with Fortran source code. 

Working through the textbook exercises taught me how to write high quality, well-documented code for Engineering applications. Demonstrations of some of the more interesting problems will
be displayed in each chapter's subfolder's README.md.
