## Fortran for Scientists and Engineers 

This repository is a collection of all the programming exercises in the book *Fortran for Scientists and Engineers*. I worked through the exercises to become 
fluent in the Fortran programming language. My motivations for learning Fortran are because I am currently working as a research assistant in the physics department 
of Kalamazoo College, and I am working with Fortran source code. I'm also quite interested in breaking through into the field of Numerical Analysis.

Working through the textbook exercises taught me how to write high quality, well-documented code for Engineering applications. Demonstrations of some of the more interesting problems will
be displayed in each chapter's subfolder's README.

This entire practice section will eventually be reorganized and turned into a Fortran module that is based off of the exercises in this book.
