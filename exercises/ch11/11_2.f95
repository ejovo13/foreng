! What kind numbers are associated with the different types of real variables 
! available on your cmopiler/computer? Determine the precision and range associated 
! with each type of real data

! Single precision :: kind = 4
! Double precision :: kind = 8
! Quadruple precision :: kind = 16

! single precision has around 9 significant digits and has highest exponent E38
! double precision has about 15 significant digits and max exponent E308
! quadruple has almost 30 significant digits and max exponent E4932
