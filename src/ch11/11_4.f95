! What is an ill-conditioned system of equations? Why is it hard to find the solution to an
! ill-conditioned set of equations.

! An ill-conditioned system of equations is one where some of the coefficients are 
! unknown. Since we are missing crucial elements in the matrix that we would like to 
! solve, finding the solution becomes much more complicated.
