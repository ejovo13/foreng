! What are the advantages and disadvantages of double-precision real numbers compared to
! single-precision real numbers? When should double precision real numbers be used instead
! of single-precision real numbers?

! Double precision offers double the number of significant digits and extends the range
! from 10E38 to 10E308. However, double precision takes up double the memory and computations 
! are slower with double precision real values.
