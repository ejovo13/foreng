! What is the difference between a subroutine and a function?

! A subroutine can modify arguments that are passed to it, but it will never have a return value.
! Functions in Fortran, just like their mathematical definition, necessarily have a return value.
! A subroutine and function is similar with respect to the fact that they both are a tool to repeat 
! and reuse code.
